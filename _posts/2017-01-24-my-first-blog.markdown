Welcome to my first blog, Thank you for taking time to read this.
At first, I was reluctant to do blogging then I thought writting makes me feel relaxed so here it is.

I started to write this blog but kept starting at my screen for 30 mins and over. with all the thoughts which are rushing in my brain I am trying to give a go to what comes to my mind and started to type this.

I am software developer by profession, It's been 4 or more years in this industry but I am rocking it, I work for Sanisoft Technologies. I love my job.

So guys this is my first post. more and more to come.

Thank you
