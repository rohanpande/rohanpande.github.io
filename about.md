<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
Thank you for visitng my blog, I am an introvert guy who lacks in public speakings, but I cover this lacuna in writting. As a child I wanted to join the army but circumstance lead me to become a computer programmer.
</p>
<p>
  I have nearly 10 years of experience in tourism industry. I love to travel, see places, bike rides, trekking, mountaineering.
</p>
<p> After my brief rendezvous with travel and tourism industry, I pursued myself to complete my studies and became a computer programmer.</p>

<p>
  I have 5 years of experience in computer programming, currently I am working as a PHP developer but I have strong interest for Ruby on rails & Python.
</p>

<p>
  I love to code, work with the team, as I have always been a team player.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you
</p>
